##  Project Description

Dream Housing Finance is looking to digitize and automate the loan eligibility process using machine learning. This Streamlit-based application classifies whether a customer is eligible (`1`) or not (`0`) for a loan based on their:

- Demographics (Gender, Marital Status, Dependents)
- Financials (Applicant Income, Coapplicant Income)
- Loan Details (Loan Amount, Term)
- Credit History and Area

---

##  Machine Learning Model

The model is trained using a classification algorithm trained on a cleaned dataset with features:

- Gender
- Married
- Dependents
- Education
- Self_Employed
- ApplicantIncome
- CoapplicantIncome
- LoanAmount
- Loan_Amount_Term
- Credit_History
- Property_Area

The target variable is `Loan_Status` (0 = Not Eligible, 1 = Eligible).
